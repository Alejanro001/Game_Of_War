# Game Of War

This is Game of War. It is my second project from my time studying Software development at General Assembly. 

## The Code

This game is built in Javascript. It's purpose is to test my ability to use and create objects and functions, manipulate arrays, and implement flow control and branching logic. This is an early project that does NOT focus on a UI design. Therefore, all of the functionality will be handled with pop ups in the browser. Feel free to take a peak at the code though.
